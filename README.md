# SICaMoT: Stress Inverssion Calcuator of Moment Tensors
A Web application to calculate the stress inversion for a group of moment tensors of seismic events within predefined geographical areas, with the help of the STRESSINVERSE and Gisola softwares. The calculations are updated as new data are identified for each defined region. For the description of the calculation areas, area sources that have been proposed in the recent past for the Greek area are used, and there is also the possibility to manually design the desired surface, thus covering more possible applications for the needs of the individual researcher. Additionally, the desired group of moment tensors can be filtered by date, magnitude, depth and rake.
